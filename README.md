# Sudoku Generator/Solver

Sudoku generator that produces unique, randomly generated numbers every time a sudoku game is created. 
The sudoku solver utilizes these hints in the same way a human would, except the solver utilizes 
a backtracking algorithm in order to explore one branch to a possible solution before moving to another branch.
